                In May, 1870 Patrick Shea emigrated from Fremoyle, County Longford, with his wife Margaret Kelly
                Shea and three daughters: Winnifred, Mary, and Bridgit (called Agnes). They sailed to Boston and then
                traveled by train to Saint Cloud, Minnesota.

                That was the end of the railroad so they rode the stagecoach to a station called Chippewa, later called
                Brandon, Minnesota. The 160-acre homestead they purchased was about seven or eight miles northeast of
                Brandon in
                Leaf Valley Township.

                As late as 1870 - twelve years after Minnesota entered the Union and five years after the Civil War -
                The
                Red River Railroad came on was still the only major track through the western part of the country.
                Patrick bought the homestead from a man in Indiana for one thousand dollars.

          <h2>Finding Minnesota</h2>
          <p>
          <p>The purchase price included land, the log house, a stable, and a building used as a granary. The Homestead
            Act of 1862 made possible the settlement of this fertile land in the midwest. Every American citizen could
            obtain title to the land after settling it for five years and making improvements. Patrick was very proud to
            own the homesteaded claim as England would not let them own land in Ireland.</p>

          <img src="img/patrick_shea_jpeg.jpeg" alt="" class="fluid"><br>
          <p>Patrick Shea</p>

          <p>Patrick had three brothers and seven sisters, as follows: Brothers - Michael, Thomas,and Richard; and
            Sisters - Mrs. Nell Shea Noonan, Mrs. Matte Shea Carney, Mrs. Hyland, Mrs. Rattigan, Mrs. Canarton, Mrs.
            Kenney, and Mrs. Costello. He was the only on of his immediate family to leave Ireland so he never saw them
            again. His daughter, Mary, planed to take him back to Ireland for a visit but then her husband Jack Conway,
            a Great Northern Railroad engineer, was killed and that was the end of the plans. (His daughter, Margaret
            Shea Kehoe, was the only on one of his 14 children ever to visit Ireland which she did twice - in 1959 and
            1972.) </p>

          <p>
            A niece, Elizabeth Shea Delaney, daughter of his brother Thomas, and her husband Timothy and two children -
            Catherine (Kindregan) and Thomas Delaney - visited the farm in 1919. We have kept in touch with the Delaneys
            through the years at their homes in Philadelphia.
          </p>

          <p>In addition to the three daughters born to Patrick and Margaret in Ireland, two more daughters were born in
            leaf Valley - Elizabeth and Anne. Soon after the baby, Anne, was born Margaret died of Pneumonia on February
            2, 1872,

            Mrs. Hubert Murrey who lived about one and one-half miles away took care of the two little girls in her
            home.
            On November 12, 1873 Patrick Shea and Catherine Mullins were married in Millerville, Minnesota in a log
            mission church; a priest came only every few months. Catherine was 27 years of age and Patrick was 43 -
            sixteen years older. </p>

          <img src="img/catherine_mullins_shea.jpeg" alt="" class="fluid"><br>
          <p>Catherine Mullins Shea</p>


          <p>To this union, nine children were born - four daughters and five sons, as follows: Ellen, Richard,
            Catherine (Katy), John, Margaret, Thomas (Tom), Peter, William (Willy), and Frances. Patrick and Catherine
            also raised a boy, Johnny Edwards, from the State School in Owatonna.

            He ran away and Joined the Merchant Marine. When he came back to Minneapolis he was so sorry to hear that
            John Shea had died that he legally changed his name to John O'Shea. (Patrick had dropped the "O" when he
            came to this country.) John O'Shea was beloved by the family.</p>
          <p>The last surviving member of the family, Frances Shea Donovan, died Jan. 8, 1990 at a Nursing Home in
            Minneapolis, Minnesota. Margaret Shea Kehoe had the longest life of anyone in the family. She was one
            hundred years and ten months old at death - Frances was eighty seven and eight months.

            Patrick Shea was survived by eleven of his fourteen children when he died on Jan. 28, 1920, Anne, John, and
            Peter preceded him in death.

            It is interesting to note that the Shea Farm was in the Shea name for eighty seven years. Mrs. William Shea
            (Minnie) sold it in 1957 to Wilmar Schultz.</p>

                they stayed about six years before leaving for their homestead in Leaf
                Valley, Minnesota. By this time the Great Northern Railroad extended to Sauk Centre, Minnesota and the

                wealthy home, considered a very good position at the time.
                Also, previously she had gone to the Hedge school in Ireland.

          <h2>Saol Fada!</h2>
          <p>Since England would not allow the Irish to
            be educated, these Hedge schools were held in secret places in the hedges. It as there, she said, that
            she got her education "at the knee of a Jesuit priest."

            She had a good education for that time and was well-read. That was particularly fortunate for her
            husband, Patrick, as he was unable to got to school and she therefore read and wrote for him.</p>
          <p>There were many hardships in the new land. They were used to a mild climate in Ireland and Minnesota had
            great variances in weather - very hot and very cold. There was fear of the Indians - some groups came but
            left peaceably after being fed. </p>

          <p>Life was very lonesome too, at times; they missed their families and friends and the social life they had
            with them. This group of twelve or so Irish families also had a language barrier with many of their
            neighbors -
            English was not a common language. Many times they walked or went by wagon the long five miles to
            Millerville and sat for a two-hour mass and never heard a word of English.

            Catherine Shea died at the age of ninety three years and six months at the home of her daughter, Margaret
            Shea Kehoe, in Alexandria, Minnesota where she lived for the last 23 years. Four of her nine children
            preceded her in death - Ellen (Sister Margaret Mary), John, Peter, and Richard. She was Born July 20, 1846
            and died Jan. 31, 1940.</p>

          <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
          <p>
            A quote from an American history book: "Shortly after the great potato famine in Ireland, 1846-1848,
            millions of Irish men and women migrated to the United States and Canada. By 1858 two million had fled and
            by the end of the century the number had increased to four million. The exodus, one of the greatest
            migrations in history, reduced Ireland's populations by one half."

            The Shea-Mullins families were a part of that exodus!

            Catherine's parents are buried in Millerville, Minn. Michael Mullins, her father died in 1877 and her mother
            died Dec. 28, 1885. (Ellen Noonan Mullins)</p>
